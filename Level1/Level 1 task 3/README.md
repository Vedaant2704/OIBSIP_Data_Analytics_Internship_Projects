# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

## About the Project
This project focuses on **data cleaning and preprocessing**, which is a critical step in the data analytics lifecycle.  
Real-world datasets often contain missing values, inconsistencies, and errors that can affect analysis outcomes.  
The aim of this project is to identify and resolve common data quality issues to prepare a reliable and analysis-ready dataset.

This project was completed as part of the **Oasis Infobyte Data Analytics Internship**.

## Objective
The primary objectives of this project include:
- Identifying missing, inconsistent, and erroneous data  
- Handling missing values using appropriate techniques  
- Detecting and removing duplicate records  
- Standardizing column names and data formats  
- Ensuring correct data types for analysis  
- Producing a clean and well-structured dataset

## Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project represents raw, unprocessed data containing typical data quality challenges such as:
- Missing values  
- Duplicate entries  
- Inconsistent column naming conventions  
- Incorrect or mixed data types  

The dataset was intentionally treated as raw data to demonstrate standard data cleaning and preprocessing practices.

## Tools and Technologies Used
The project was implemented using the following tools and libraries:

- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and cleaning  
- **NumPy** for numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for exploratory visual checks  
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **VS Code**

## Data Cleaning Steps
A systematic approach was followed during the preprocessing stage:

1. Loaded and explored the dataset to understand its structure  
2. Identified missing values and duplicate records  
3. Standardized column names for consistency and readability  
4. Applied appropriate methods to handle missing data  
5. Removed duplicate observations  
6. Corrected data types where necessary  
7. Identified potential outliers for further inspection  
8. Generated and saved the cleaned dataset

## Key Observations
- Multiple columns contained missing values requiring treatment.  
- Duplicate records were detected and successfully removed.  
- Standardized column naming improved dataset readability.  
- Correct data types are essential for accurate analysis.  
- Data quality improved significantly after preprocessing.

## Outcome
After the data cleaning process, the dataset became:
- Well-structured and consistent  
- Free from duplicate and redundant records  
- Ready for analysis or machine learning tasks  
- Easier to interpret, maintain, and reuse  

A cleaned version of the dataset was saved for downstream analysis.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the importance of **data cleaning and preprocessing** in data analytics.  
Clean data forms the foundation of reliable analysis and meaningful insights.  
The methods applied in this project reflect real-world data preparation practices used by data professionals.
