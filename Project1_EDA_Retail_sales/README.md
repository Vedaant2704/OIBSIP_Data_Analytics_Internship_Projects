## Dataset Information
The dataset contains transaction-level retail sales data. The main columns used in the analysis are:

- `transaction_id` – Unique identifier for each transaction  
- `date` – Date of purchase  
- `customer_id` – Unique customer identifier  
- `gender` – Gender of the customer  
- `age` – Age of the customer  
- `product_category` – Category of the product purchased  
- `quantity` – Number of items purchased  
- `price_per_unit` – Price per unit  
- `total_amount` – Total value of the transaction

## Tools and Technologies
The analysis was performed using:

- Python  
- Pandas for data analysis  
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

## Visual Analysis
The following visualizations were created to better understand the data:

- Total sales by product category  
- Sales trend over time  
- Gender-wise sales distribution  
- Customer age distribution  
- Relationship between quantity purchased and total sales  

All generated charts are saved in the `visuals` folder.
